    abstract: `Presenting DBox Plus, an extension of the Decomposition Box system that scaffolds programming education through structured decomposition and abstraction. Implemented in React/TypeScript with Pyodide and OpenAIâ€™s gpt-4o, the system provides an interactive step tree, progressive hints, and an abstraction overlay highlighting reusable patterns. A user study (n=7) showed strong usability (SUS = 77) and learning gains, though some participants struggled bridging abstract reasoning with syntax. Findings suggest DBox Plus fosters modular thinking while highlighting future needs in durable abstraction practices and AI collaboration.`,
